## **Designing Phase**

### Inspiration
The main concept of my webpage is to represent myself. I started choosing a color palette by looking at my wardrobe as it collectively demonstrate what color I like most. Eventually I decided that my main color pallete will focus on different shades of black and white, and look for a contrasting color to give a positive mood to the page.

### Image Selection
Images are gathered from [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com.au/) and [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)

Final image to use as background for the website is:
