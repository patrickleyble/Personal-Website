# **PROJECT 2** 

The purpose of the project is to create a personal static webpage that will showcase skills regarding html, CSS, and designing.

## **Designing Phase**

### Inspiration
The main concept of my webpage is to represent myself. I started choosing a color palette by looking at my wardrobe as it collectively demonstrate what color I like most. Eventually I decided that my main color pallete will focus on different shades of black and white, and look for a contrasting color to give a positive mood to the page.
